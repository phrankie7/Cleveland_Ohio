According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the country. In this data report, we will focus on heart disease in Cleveland, Ohio, one of the major cities in the United States. The report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the prevalence and risk factors associated with heart disease in Cleveland, based on data from various sources such as medical records, surveys, and public health reports. By understanding the trends and patterns of heart disease in Cleveland, we hope to inform policymakers, healthcare providers, and the public on how to improve heart health and reduce the burden of heart disease in the city.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"OCD7XWSQu4QY"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"EOdf6iUCw2H1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683512506847,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":123,"user":{"displayName":"Frank Ebere","userId":"17482672119294677235"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Libriares required for this analysis.\n","\n","Pandas  \n","Numpy  \n","Drive\n","\n","**Pandas** will be used for manipulatin and analyzing the data.  \n","**Drive** We will be reading the CSV from Google drive using the Drive Library.  \n","**Numpy** - The NumPy support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays."],"metadata":{"id":"_g7y_Dh9v677"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aQcbg5wVX9J7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1683512508452,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1462,"user":{"displayName":"Frank Ebere","userId":"17482672119294677235"}},"outputId":"739003de-6a55-4c1e-e791-65a998cc38b7"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Part 1**\n","\n","We will review the dataset as exported from Kaggle and rename each column header matching the supporting details below, referencing all NOMINAL data.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","**Age**:  \n","Patients Age in years (Numeric)\n","\n","**Sex**:   \n","Gender (Male : 1; Female : 0) (Nominal)\n","\n","**cp**:   \n","Type of chest pain experienced by patient.
